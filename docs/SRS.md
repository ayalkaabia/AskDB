1 Introduction
1.1 Purpose of this document
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the functional and non‑functional requirements for a natural‑language query assistant being developed under the Dell–Tsofen programme. The goal of the project is to allow users to explore data stored in database files without needing to write Structured Query Language (SQL) by hand. Instead, a user will be able to ask questions or describe analyses in plain language, and the system will convert those questions into safe, executable SQL queries, run them against a provided database and return results in a user‑friendly format. The SRS is intended for developers, testers and project stakeholders to provide a shared understanding of what the system must do and what constraints apply.
1.2 Scope
The product will accept either raw data (e.g., CSV or JSON) or an existing database file as input and will build or connect to a local database accordingly. It will then present an interface—initially a command‑line interface (CLI)—through which users can enter natural‑language prompts. Using a GPT‑based large language model (LLM) via the OpenAI API, the assistant will translate those prompts into SQL statements, validate them against the database schema, execute them safely and display the results. The same interface should be portable across different Dell products and datasets. While the first version will run in a Linux terminal, the architecture should not preclude later expansion to graphical or web‑based interfaces.
1.3 Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations
Term	Description
CLI	Command‑line interface. The initial user interface for the assistant will be a text‑based prompt within a terminal.
SQL	Structured Query Language, used to query and manipulate relational databases.
NL	Natural language—spoken or written human language.
LLM	Large Language Model; in this context, GPT‑based models from OpenAI that convert natural language into SQL.
Schema	The structure of a database, including table names, column names and relationships (foreign keys).
CSV	Comma‑separated values; a simple text format for tabular data.
JSON	JavaScript Object Notation; a text format for hierarchical data structures.

1.5 Overview of document
The remainder of this SRS is organised as follows: Section 2 gives an overall description of the product and its intended users. Section 3 enumerates the functional requirements. Section 4 lists the non‑functional requirements. Section 5 discusses external interface requirements. Section 6 lists assumptions and constraints, followed by an appendix describing desirable (nice‑to‑have) features that are not part of the minimum viable product.
1.6 Business objectives
The Dell–Tsofen data exploration interface is intended to achieve several business objectives, as outlined in the accompanying Business Requirements Document (BRD). First, it must speed up data exploration so that users no longer need to wait for database administrators or analysts to write SQL queries. Second, it must allow users to interact with data naturally, without rigid SQL syntax. Third, the tool should enable easy exploration of data relationships and trends without requiring users to build dashboards or write manual queries. Fourth, it will provide a unified interface that can be reused across different Dell products. Finally, by empowering employees at all technical levels to access insights quickly and securely, the system supports better, faster decision‑making.
1.7 Revenue model
While the SRS focuses on functional and technical requirements, the BRD identifies potential revenue streams associated with the product. Dell may adopt an enterprise licensing model, bundling the assistant with its enterprise software solutions. A subscription model could offer premium features such as auto‑suggestions, SQL explanations and chat‑style interactions. Additional support and services—consulting, integration and custom deployment—provide further revenue opportunities. Internally, the system may generate productivity gains by reducing dependence on analysts and accelerating data‑driven workflows.
1.8 Market analysis
The BRD notes that the market for AI‑driven data exploration tools is expanding. Organisations face challenges in democratising data access while maintaining security and accuracy. Competing products include ThoughtSpot, Tableau’s Ask Data and Microsoft Power BI Q&A. Dell can differentiate by integrating the assistant directly into its products and focusing on the needs of enterprise clients. Key market opportunities include the growing demand for self‑service analytics, increasing adoption of AI‑powered productivity tools, and the need for cross‑platform natural‑language query solutions. The emphasis on reducing time‑to‑insight and lowering operational costs aligns with enterprise priorities and makes a strong case for the product.
2 Overall description
2.1 Product perspective
Modern data‑driven organisations often rely on analysts or database administrators to translate business questions into SQL. This process introduces bottlenecks, delays and friction. The Dell–Tsofen product aims to speed up data exploration by removing the need to wait for DB admins or analysts. Instead, users interact with the data “the way they think” in plain language, and the assistant translates those questions into SQL for them. The tool will also allow users to optionally view or edit the generated SQL. It is envisioned as a reusable component that can be integrated across different Dell products and datasets.
2.2 Product functions
The assistant will provide the following high‑level capabilities:
Database import and validation – Accept a data file (CSV or JSON) and build a relational database from it, or accept an existing database file. Validate the file type and notify the user if it is not supported.
Prompt‑to‑SQL conversion – Convert natural‑language questions into safe SQL queries using a GPT‑based model. The assistant must understand synonyms and context (e.g., treating “clients” the same as “customers”).
Query execution and result display – Run the generated SQL against the loaded database, handle errors gracefully and display results in a human‑readable table. Users can optionally edit and rerun the SQL.
History and export – Maintain a history of past prompts and queries so users can revisit them, and allow exporting results to CSV or JSON.
Guidance and feedback – Provide helpful tooltips or examples to guide prompt writing. Show clear messages if the assistant cannot translate a prompt, if a query fails, or if it returns no data.
2.3 User classes and characteristics
The product is aimed at non‑technical business users, such as product managers, analysts and marketing specialists, who need insights from data but may not be proficient in SQL. These users value a friendly interface and rapid turnaround. Secondary users include data engineers or database administrators who may oversee data import and monitor query safety. No advanced computer skills are assumed beyond basic familiarity with a command‑line interface, although future versions may provide graphical interfaces.
2.4 Operating environment
The application will be deployed as a backend service written in Node.js/Express and a frontend interface built in React. Both components will run on Linux servers or in containers and should be compatible with common distributions such as Ubuntu or Fedora. The backend exposes RESTful endpoints for uploading data, generating SQL and running queries; the frontend consumes these endpoints and provides an interactive user interface. A MySQL relational database stores imported data, and access to the internet is required to call the GPT‑based OpenAI API for natural‑language processing. When running locally, developers may still interact via a command‑line interface; however, the primary user experience is through the web application.
2.5 Design and implementation constraints
Safety – The assistant must enforce SQL safety. It should not allow arbitrary SQL injection or data‑destructive commands such as DROP TABLE. Only read‑only queries and explicitly whitelisted update commands for database amendment should be allowed.
Model usage – The system will use a GPT‑based model via the OpenAI API. API rate limits and cost considerations must be taken into account. When offline, the assistant should provide an informative error message.
Database size – The tool is intended for small‑ to medium‑sized datasets (up to a few million rows). Large datasets may require additional optimisation not covered here.
2.6 Assumptions and dependencies
Users will supply clean, well‑formatted CSV or JSON files, or existing database files.
Users have internet access to call the OpenAI API.
The natural‑language understanding will be limited by the capabilities of the underlying LLM. It may occasionally misinterpret ambiguous queries; therefore, user education and clear error messages are important.
Database schemas may include relationships (foreign keys) which the assistant must consider.
3 Functional requirements
This section specifies the system’s capabilities in detail. Each requirement is labelled FR‑x for reference.
3.1 Database import and management
ID	Requirement	Rationale
FR‑1	The system shall allow the user to upload a data file (CSV or JSON) and automatically build a relational database from it.	Users may not start with a database file, so the tool must be able to create one.
FR‑2	The system shall allow the user to upload or select an existing database file and connect to it.	Supports users who already have a database.
FR‑3	The system shall validate the file type of any uploaded data or database and display an error if it is unsupported.	Prevents attempts to load incompatible formats.
FR‑4	The system shall infer the schema (table names, column names, relationships) from the uploaded data and store it for prompt‑to‑SQL translation.	The LLM needs schema information to generate accurate queries.
FR‑5	The system shall maintain a history of past prompts and generated SQL queries, accessible to the user for review.	Allows users to revisit and reuse previous analyses.
FR‑6	The system shall allow users to export query results to CSV or JSON files.	Users often need to save results for reporting or further analysis.

FR‑13	The system shall display results in a tabular format with column headers and rows, formatted for readability.	Users need to interpret results quickly.
FR‑14	The system shall display clear error messages when a query cannot be generated from the prompt, fails to run, or returns no data.	Improves user experience and aids troubleshooting.
FR‑15	The system shall provide helpful tooltips or example prompts to guide users in formulating queries.	Reduces the learning curve for new users.
FR‑16	The system shall support commands to amend the database, such as adding or updating records, and shall display reasoning and confirmation messages.	Enables data modification when needed, while maintaining transparency.
3.4 History and suggestions
ID	Requirement	Rationale
FR‑17	The system shall keep track of user prompts, generated SQL and results in chronological order, accessible via a history command.	Users often need to revisit previous questions.
FR‑18	The system should, as an enhancement, provide live auto‑suggestions as the user types a prompt.	Assists with query formulation and reduces typing effort.
FR‑19	The system should provide an option to explain the SQL, presenting a plain‑language description of what the generated query does.	Builds user trust and understanding of the system’s actions.
FR‑20	The system should support a chat‑style interface that remembers context, allowing follow‑up commands such as “Now sort them by date”.	Facilitates multi‑step analyses and conversational workflows.
4 Non‑functional requirements
4.1 Usability
The interface shall be friendly and easy to use, requiring minimal training.
The command‑line prompts and messages shall be clear, concise and free of jargon.
Tooltips and examples shall be provided to assist users in formulating queries.
4.2 Performance
Query translation and execution should complete within a reasonable time (ideally less than a few seconds for typical datasets). Long‑running queries shall show progress or status indicators.
The system shall handle datasets up to a few million rows with acceptable performance; out‑of‑scope performance tuning may be required for larger datasets.
4.3 Reliability and availability
The system shall provide clear error handling and recovery for invalid inputs, API errors, database connection issues and unexpected failures.
If the OpenAI API is unavailable, the system shall notify the user and offer to retry later.
4.4 Security
The system shall prevent SQL injection and unauthorised data manipulation.
API keys and credentials used to access the OpenAI API shall be stored securely and never logged or exposed to users.
User data and query history shall be stored locally unless explicitly shared.
4.5 Portability
The application shall run on common Linux distributions. Future versions may support Windows and macOS.
The architecture should allow replacement of the GPT‑based model with alternative natural‑language processing services if required.
4.6 Maintainability
The codebase shall be modular, separating user interface, prompt processing, SQL generation, query execution and history management.
Configuration values such as API keys, rate limits and database locations shall be externalised to configuration files or environment variables.
5 External interface requirements
5.1 User interface
Command‑line interface (MVP) – The initial version will run in a terminal. It shall prompt users to load data, accept questions, display SQL previews and show results in a table. Colour highlighting may be used to improve readability.
Future graphical/web interface (optional) – Later versions may include a web‑based or graphical interface using similar functionality. This is considered outside the minimum scope but should be enabled by the modular design.
5.2 Hardware interface
There are no special hardware requirements. The system will run on a standard computer capable of running Linux.
5.3 Software interface
Database engine – SQLite will be used for storing and querying data tables. Other engines (e.g., PostgreSQL) may be supported in later versions.
OpenAI API – The system will integrate with OpenAI’s API for prompt‑to‑SQL translation. The API must be reachable via HTTPS.
5.4 Communication interface
The application shall communicate with the OpenAI API over the internet using HTTPS. No external network communications are required for local database operations.
6 Assumptions, dependencies and future enhancements
6.1 Assumptions
Users provide accurate and complete data files when building databases.
Internet connectivity is available for API requests.
The underlying language model remains capable of translating the supported queries; quality may change as models evolve.
6.2 Dependencies
OpenAI GPT model and API availability.
MySQL database server.
Node.js runtime and associated libraries (Express, MySQL drivers) for the backend.
React and associated JavaScript libraries for the frontend.
6.3 Future enhancements (nice‑to‑have)
The requirements below are desirable but not required for the minimum viable product:
Live auto suggestions – As the user types a question, the system suggests possible completions or clarifies ambiguous terms.
SQL explanation – After a query is generated, the assistant provides a natural‑language explanation of what the SQL does.
Conversational context – A chat‑style interface where follow‑up prompts can refine previous queries, e.g., “Now sort them by date”.
Graphical interface – A web or desktop GUI that presents data and prompts more visually.
Role‑based access control – Integration with authentication systems to restrict who can view or modify data.
7 Appendix – Illustrative examples
To clarify the intended behaviour, the original requirements document included three short examples. They are reproduced here to aid understanding.
Building a database file – When given raw data for customers and orders, the assistant infers tables (e.g., Customers with columns id, name, city and Orders with columns id, customer_id, date, total) and builds a database.
Column selection – When a user asks a simple question (e.g., “What is John’s location?”), the assistant identifies the relevant column, constructs the SQL query and returns the answer in a table.
Analytical query – For an analysis request such as “Get the top 5 selling products this year”, the assistant produces a SQL query like SELECT name, SUM(sales) FROM products WHERE year = 2025 GROUP BY name ORDER BY SUM(sales) DESC LIMIT 5;. The user can run this query and edit it if necessary.
8 Business requirements
The Business Requirements Document (BRD) complements this SRS by outlining the high‑level rationale, objectives and commercial context for the project. This section summarises the key elements of the BRD so that the technical requirements remain aligned with the business goals.
8.1 Executive summary
The Dell–Tsofen Data Exploration Interface is intended to make data exploration conversational. Instead of writing SQL or waiting for database administrators, users will ask questions in their own words and receive immediate answers. By embedding the tool across Dell products, the company aims to simplify data exploration, increase productivity and accelerate decision‑making.
8.2 Business objectives
The project targets several business objectives:
Speed and autonomy – Eliminate delays associated with waiting for analysts or DB administrators by allowing end‑users to explore data directly.
Natural interaction – Enable users to interact with data in plain language rather than rigid SQL syntax.
Ease of insight – Allow exploration of relationships and trends without building dashboards or writing manual queries.
Cross‑product consistency – Provide a unified interface that can be reused across Dell’s product ecosystem.
Empowerment – Make data accessible to employees at all technical levels, improving security and compliance by limiting the need for privileged DB accounts.
8.3 Revenue model
The BRD identifies several ways the interface can contribute to Dell’s revenue and cost savings:
Enterprise licensing – Sell the interface as part of Dell’s enterprise software offerings.
Subscription tiers – Offer premium features, such as auto‑suggestions, SQL explanations and chat‑style interfaces, through subscription plans.
Professional services – Generate revenue through consulting, integration and custom deployments.
