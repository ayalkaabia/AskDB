Deploying the Dell – Tsofen Data Exploration Interface
This document describes how to deploy the backend service, the user interface and the AI integration required by the Dell–Tsofen Data Exploration Interface. The system comprises a backend API that manages data ingestion and SQL generation, an optional frontend interface (command‑line or web), and integration with the OpenAI API for natural‑language understanding.
1. Prerequisites
Before deploying any component, ensure the following:
Operating system: A Linux server (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04 LTS) with shell access.
Node.js environment: Node.js 16+ and npm are required to run the Express backend and build the React frontend.
Database: MySQL is used to store imported data and execute queries. Ensure a MySQL server is installed and a database is created for the application. You can adapt the instructions to other relational databases if needed.
OpenAI API key: The natural‑language to SQL translation uses a GPT‑based model. Obtain an API key and set it as an environment variable (OPENAI_API_KEY).
2. Backend deployment
The backend service exposes endpoints for uploading data, generating SQL from prompts, running queries and returning results. The reference implementation uses Node.js with Express.
Clone the repository on your server:
git clone https://github.com/your‑organisation/dell‑tsofen‑nl‑sql.git
cd dell‑tsofen‑nl‑sql
Install dependencies:
cd server
npm install
Configure environment variables:
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
export MYSQL_HOST=localhost
export MYSQL_PORT=3306
export MYSQL_DATABASE=your_database
export MYSQL_USER=your_user
export MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password
Start the backend service:
npm start
The service will be available at http://<server-ip>:8000/. Endpoints include /upload to accept CSV/JSON files, /query to convert prompts to SQL and execute them, and /history to fetch past queries.
Configure a process manager (recommended): In production, run the service under a process manager like PM2, systemd or Supervisor to handle restarts and logging.
3. Frontend deployment
3. Frontend deployment
The primary user interface is a web application built with React. After deploying the backend, set up and serve the frontend as follows:
Navigate to the client directory:
cd client
Install dependencies:
npm install
Configure the API endpoint: Create a .env file pointing to the backend URL:
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://<server-ip>:8000
Build and serve the frontend:
npm run build
npm install -g serve
serve -s build -l 3000
The web UI will be accessible at http://<server-ip>:3000/. It allows users to upload datasets, ask questions in natural language, edit SQL, view results, export data and view query history.
4. AI service configuration
The assistant uses the OpenAI API to translate natural‑language prompts into SQL. To deploy this integration securely:
Obtain an API key from OpenAI and ensure your account has sufficient quota.
Store the key securely—prefer environment variables or a secrets manager (e.g. AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault). Do not hard‑code keys in source files or commit them to version control.
Handle rate limits and errors—implement exponential backoff and informative error messages when the API is unavailable.
Monitor costs and usage—track API calls and configure alerts to prevent unexpected charges.
5. Scaling and security considerations
Database scaling: MySQL scales well for moderate workloads when properly tuned. For very large datasets or high concurrency, consider a more scalable engine (e.g. PostgreSQL or a managed MySQL cluster) and configure connection pooling and indexes for performance.
Authentication and authorisation: Add authentication middleware to restrict API usage. Role‑based access control can limit who can amend the database.
SSL/TLS: Terminate connections behind a reverse proxy (e.g. Nginx) configured with TLS certificates to secure traffic.
Deployment automation: Consider containerisation (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for repeatable deployments.
6. Maintenance
After deployment:
Regularly update dependencies and apply security patches.
Periodically review prompt logs and query history to improve synonym handling and refine the language model prompts.
Review API usage and adjust subscription plans or rate limits accordingly.
By following these steps, you can deploy the backend, frontend and AI components of the Dell–Tsofen Data Exploration Interface on a production server and make it available to your users.
